THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

4th Week progress/summary:

Our key goal for the fourth week of the project is to incorporate the most popular, highest rated, and upcoming movies into the program. 
This entailed getting data from relevant APIs, analyzing it, and then slickly displaying it in the user interface.

I created a simple and user-friendly UI style for the ChatGPT search bar.

This task's purpose was to create a toggle function that easily transitions the user interface between the home page and the search bar. 
This feature allows users to swiftly move between the various sections of the application.


Tasks I have DONE:

I have developed technical UI design of the ChatGPT search bar focuses on clarity and versatility. Functionality is enhanced via responsive layout concepts, CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, and backend tools such as Elasticsearch. The integration of accessibility features, consistent branding, and ongoing user testing all contribute to a clean, user-friendly interface across devices.
