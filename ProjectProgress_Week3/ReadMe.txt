THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

3rd Week Progress/Summary:

For the third week of the project, 
 Our primary goal was to incorporate The Movie Database (TMDB) API into our program to increase its functionality.

Integration of the TMDB API:
 We were able to successfully integrate the TMDB API into our application in order to access a large database of movie information. 
 Obtaining up-to-date information about various movies, such as their title, genre, release date, and other specifics.

Update the Movies Data in the Store:
 In order to efficiently handle the movie data that was retrieved, 
 we made improvements to our application's state management system, which typically makes use of a store (such as Redux). 
 We created a specific "movie slice" in our state management system to further simplify the processing of data relevant to

Planning the Structure of the Main and Secondary Containers: 
 In preparation for the display of movie information on the HOME page, we began planning the structure of the main and secondary containers. 
 These containers are critical for organizing and presenting movie data in an understandable manner.

Data Retrieval for Trailer Video:
 We began implementing the ability to retrieve trailer videos for each film, in addition to the regular movie metadata. One way this feature improves the
 user experience is the ability to watch trailers directly from the program.


Tasks I have DONE this Week:

 I've included a functionality that allows for the direct embedding of YouTube trailers within our application.
 This functionality dramatically improves user experience by allowing users to access trailers without leaving our site.
 Using movie IDs for embedding ensures a clear preview of films, allowing consumers to make informed judgments about what to watch.
