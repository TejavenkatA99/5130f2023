The AI Film Factory: 

Progress/summary of 2nd Week:

During this week our main focus was, on setting up elements of the project. We achieved milestones in configuring Google Firebase for user authentication and validation. Some noteworthy features were implemented.Implemented the functionality for the signup page and and username and password will be saved in the firebase.

1.Google Firebase Configuration:

We set up authentication using Firebase to verify user sign up details.
Implemented error handling for incorrect login credentials invalid email formats and password criteria using regex patterns.

2.Redux Integration:

We incorporated Redux for state management.
Implemented actions to handle user login functionality.
Configured a store to manage the applications state.

Accomplishments and Details:

1.Google Firebase Integration:

Our team successfully completed the configuration of Google Firebase to handle user authentication and validation. This involved implementing Firebases authentication services to ensure the security and validity of user sign up details. The system can now. Address errors related to login credentials invalid email formats and password requirements based on established regex patterns.

2.Redux Implementation:

By integrating Redux into our project architecture we have established a framework for managing the applications state. This implementation included configuring a store that holds all the data, for the entire application.

In addition we used Redux to dispatch actions, for user login, which improved the user authentication process.

Tasks for the week3:

Next our main focus will be, on integrating the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. Our goal is to retrieve a list of movies, including their titles, posters and detailed descriptions. These movie details will then be used to create and show movie cards on the user interface.

Obstacles while developing:

Although Firebase and Redux were configured without any issues, there were a few difficulties in guaranteeing a smooth integration and maximizing their functions.
To overcome these obstacles, the team needed to pay close attention to detail and work together to solve problems.
